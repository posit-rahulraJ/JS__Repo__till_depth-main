You're practicing some excellent core JavaScript fundamentals here! 🙌  
Let me refine your code a bit, correct a small typo in the comment, and give you a **clear breakdown** of what you're doing, plus where this is used in **real tech stacks**.

### ✅ Cleaned & Explained Version:

```js
// -----------------------------
// 🔒 const, let, and var
// -----------------------------

/* 
🔐 const: Value cannot be changed after declaration.
🟨 let and var are used when values can change.
    However, const is **preferred** over let/var in modern JavaScript
    for values that shouldn't change.

📌 Comparison:

Keyword   | Scope          | Hoisting               | Reassignment | Redeclaration
----------|----------------|------------------------|--------------|---------------
var       | Function-scoped| Yes                    | ✅ Yes       | ✅ Yes
let       | Block-scoped   | Yes (TDZ - uninitialized) | ✅ Yes    | ❌ No
const     | Block-scoped   | Yes (TDZ - uninitialized) | ❌ No    | ❌ No
*/

const accountId = 144553;
let bookish = 9999;
var bookisher = 4545;

// ❌ Error: Assignment to constant variable
// accountId = 2

console.log(accountId);  // 144553
console.log(bookish);    // 9999
console.log(bookisher);  // 4545
```

### ⚠️ Corrections:
- In your comment, you wrote: `/* comst cant be changed... */`  
  ✅ Correct spelling: `const can't be changed`

### 🧠 Tech Stack Use-Cases:

| Use-Case                                   | Keyword   | Why?                              |
|--------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------|
| Fixed configuration (e.g., API keys)       | `const`   | Prevent accidental changes        |
| Loop counters or temporary variables       | `let`     | Value changes inside loops/blocks |
| Legacy code or function-scoped vars        | `var`     | Only for maintaining old code     |

### 🔥 Pro Tip (Interview Use):

**Q: Why is `const` preferred in modern JavaScript?**  
🧠 Because it helps **prevent bugs** by making sure values that shouldn't change *actually* don’t change. Most modern tools (like ESLint, Prettier) recommend using `const` by default, and only use `let` if reassignment is necessary.
